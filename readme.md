# Python Fun Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I enjoy working on when I'm bored or exploring different aspects of Python. These projects serve as learning exercises and allow me to experiment with various concepts and libraries.

## Projects

### Case Opening Simulator Auto Sell
The Case Opening Simulator Auto Sell is a script that simulates a case opening simulator, where you can open virtual cases and automatically sell the items you receive. This project provided inspiration for another related project.

### Screen Recorder
The Screen Recorder script allows you to record your computer screen and save it as a video file. It shares similarities with the Case Opening Simulator Auto Sell project, as they both utilize similar libraries. Ongoing development focuses on optimizing CPU and memory usage for improved performance.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
